# One File Reinforcement Learning (OneFileRL)

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithms Repository! This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various RL algorithms, each encapsulated within a single file. Whether you're a student diving into RL for the first time or a seasoned researcher looking to experiment with different algorithms, this repository is designed to make your journey smoother and more insightful.

## Motivation
Understanding RL algorithms often involves navigating complex codebases with intricate interdependencies. Our approach simplifies this by isolating each algorithm into its own self-contained file. Each file includes essential components such as replay buffers, neural network architectures, and agent classes. This modular structure not only facilitates easier comprehension but also enables seamless integration into your projects.

## Supported Algorithms
Currently, the repository includes implementations of several fundamental RL algorithms, including:

* Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)
* Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN)
* Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

Each algorithm is implemented with Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.7.1.
